# :wave: This is Boray Tuna Goren

## Learn about me 

I've been swimming competitively for over 14 years and had the privilege of coming to the United States to swim at the Division I level. As a gamer, I've always been interested in the development side of programs and hope to incorporate this into my future in computer science and game development.

I pride myself in my leadership and commitment to the team by bringing people together. When faced with a responsibility or project, I work to ensure it is done efficiently and effectively while being proud of my work.

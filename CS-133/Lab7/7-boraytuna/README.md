# Data Set & Exploratory Questions

## Part 1
1. Brainstorm some data sets you think you'd be interested in analyzing.
* What are you interested in?
* What are you passionate about?
2. Answer the above questions in your lab report.

## Part 2
1. Explore available data sets online. Good resources are [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data), [CORGIS](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/), [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets), and [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace).
2. Choose a data set that you'll explore later in the semester and get to know it. You will need to open each file and inspect it closely to accomplish this.
  * Q1: Where did this data come from?
  * Q2: What are the data fields?
  * Q3: What do the values for each data field mean?
  * Q4: What files are provided?
  * Q5: What is the file format?
3. Answer the above questions in your lab report.

## Part 3
Generate some exploratory questions you'll attempt to answer based on your interests and the available data. Again, you will need to open each file and inspect it closely to accomplish this.
* These are exploratory questions! You will not be able to determine answers to big, broad questions like the meaning of life from these data sets.
* Make sure you'll be able to answer your questions based on the available data and basic analysis approaches (statistics and data visualizations).

## Report
* Document your answers in labreport.md. The report should be broken down into three parts to mirror the above prompts. Include enough information to show that you thought deeply about each prompt (i.e. show your work).

## Submit
* Stage your report (labreport.md)
* Commit to the GitHub repository for grading

## Specifications to Pass

* Lab report contains three parts:
  * Part 1: Contains a list of at least 5 separate topics you are interested in or passionate about
  * Part 2:
    * Q1 is answered beyond the website (e.g. Kaggle or AWS), explaining where the original data came from. If you are unable to make this determination, explain how you tried to find the source and where you think it may have come from.
    * Q2-Q5 is answered completely based on the actual provided files. If documentation is not provided for the data, for questions Q2-Q4 explain how you tried to find the information and what you think the data means.
  * Part 3: Contains a list of at least 3 deep questions that could be explored based on this data. Questions should go beyond simple summary statistical questions like: How many X did Y? You may also include these questions in your report, but they must be in a separate list, and they will not count towards your 3 deep questions.

# Chapter 4 Lab - Instructions

## Code
* Write code in mypolygon.py as described in Chapter 4 of the textbook and in the comments

## Document
* Remember to put comments in your code as documentation
* For each exercise, capture and save a screenshot of your entire desktop showing the running code
  * Save the screenshot to the same folder as this markdown file

## Report
* Replace "screenshot.jpg" in the labreport.md with your the relevant filename for the given exercise
  * Do not modify the image width of 800px
* For each exercise, explain what you think the point was in the reflection section. Why were you asked to do this? What should you have learned?

## Submit
* Stage your revised code (mypolygon.py), report (labreport.md), and all screenshots
* Commit to the GitHub repository for grading

## Specifications to Pass
* Lab report contains five 800px wide screenshots of your entire desktop that shows each exercise's functioning code
* Lab report contains five reflections that describe a feasible lesson that you should have learned from that particular exercise
* Functioning and appropriately commented code that uses a turtle object to draw:
  1. A square with a hard coded size in a function named square_one
  2. A square with a size (length) passed as an argument into a function named square_two
  3. A n-sided polygon, where n and size (length) are both passed as arguments into a function named polygon
  4. A rough approximation of a circle of a particular radius that relies on the previous polygon function
  5. A better approximation of a circle by refactoring prior code into functions named: polyline, arc, polygon_refactored, and circle_refactored

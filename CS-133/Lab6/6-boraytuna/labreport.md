## Ethical Reflection
***Reflect on the ethics of this code using the questions in the README.md file.***
* Data is used for advertising purposes to personalize the ads shown to users based on their demographics, behaviors, and preferences, thereby increasing the likelihood of engagement. By analyzing data such as age, gender, relationship status, and number of friends, inferences can be drawn about a person's lifestyle or personality, often allowing advertisers to predict interests beyond what users explicitly share. This allows advertisers not only to tailor what products are promoted but also how the ads are presented, adjusting tone and messaging to appeal more effectively to different groups. However, this raises ethical concerns, as using personal data in this way may reinforce stereotypes or biases, making it crucial to approach such personalization with fairness and sensitivity to avoid harmful assumptions or exploitation of users.

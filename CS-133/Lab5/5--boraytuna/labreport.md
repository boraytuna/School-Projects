## Ethical Reflection
***Reflect on the ways in which different scoring algorithms can advantage or harm different groups of people.***
* The scoring algorithm tends to benefit students who are involved in more activities or face certain challenges, like student athletes, those with disabilities, resident assistants, or international students. These groups gain extra points, which gives them an advantage in housing priority. However, students who do not belong to these categories, especially those with fewer credits or who donâ€™t have special circumstances like disabilities or high credit loads, might be overlooked. This could result in less priority for students who still have important housing needs but don't fit the specific criteria used in the algorithm.
